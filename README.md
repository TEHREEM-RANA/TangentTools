## 🧠 Calculus Concepts Applied
The calculator utilizes the gradient vector $\nabla f$ to find the normal to the surface:
1. **Partial Derivatives:** Computing $f_x, f_y,$ and $f_z$.
2. **Tangent Plane Equation:** $f_x(P_0)(x-x_0) + f_y(P_0)(y-y_0) + f_z(P_0)(z-z_0) = 0$.
3. **Normal Line:** Equations based on the direction ratios derived from the gradient.

## 📌 Future Roadmap
- [ ] **Graphical Visualization:** Adding 3D plots to visualize the surface and its tangent plane.
- [ ] **Advanced Parsing:** Supporting more complex trigonometric and logarithmic functions.
- [ ] **Mobile Optimization:** Improving the UI for better accessibility on smaller screens.
